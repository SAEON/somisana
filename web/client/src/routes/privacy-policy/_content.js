Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy we provide this notice explaining our online information practices. If you have additional questions or require more information about our Privacy Policy, do not hesitate to contact us.

We do not share information that we collect with outside parties.

Finally, we never use or share the personally identifiable information provided to us online in ways unrelated to the ones described.

# Log Files
SAEON Data Portal follows a standard procedure of using log files. These files log visitors when they visit websites. All websites do this. The information collected by log files include internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet Service Provider (ISP), date and time stamp, referring/exit pages, and page usage information (clicks and mouse tracking). These are not linked to any information that is personally identifiable. The purpose of the information is for analysing trends, administering the site, tracking users' movement on the website, and gathering demographic information.

# Cookies and Web Beacons
Like any other website, SAEON Data Portal uses 'cookies'. These cookies are used to store information including visitors' preferences, and the pages on the website that the visitor accessed or visited. The information is used to optimize the users' experience by customizing our web page content based on visitors' browser type and/or other information.

For more general information on cookies, please read the "What Are Cookies" article on Cookie Consent website.

# Personal information we collect
Personal information is collected insofar as it is necessary to identify and authenticate users, only when users authenticate with the ODP. Such information is limited to profile information from services that this software uses for authentication purposes (Google, Twitter, etc.) and email addresses used for identification (and no other) purposes.

# Third Party Privacy Policies
SAEON Data Portal's Privacy Policy does not apply to other advertisers or websites. Thus, we are advising you to consult the respective Privacy Policies of these third-party websites or ad servers for more detailed information. It may include their practices and instructions about how to opt-out of certain options.

You can choose to disable cookies through your individual browser options.

Another part of our priority is adding protection for children while using the internet. We encourage parents and guardians to observe, participate in, and/or monitor and guide their online activity.

SAEON Data Portal does not knowingly collect any Personal Identifiable Information from children under the age of 13. If you think that your child provided this kind of information on our website, we strongly encourage you to contact us immediately and we will do our best efforts to promptly remove such information from our records.

To prevent unauthorised access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online.

# Online Privacy Policy Only
