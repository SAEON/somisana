This report presents the setup and validation of a regional CROCO model configuration for the
Algoa Bay region, located on the eastern extent of the Agulhas Bank, South Africa. The perfor-
mance of the model solution is assessed over a 2.5 year period from May 2009 to December
2011, coinciding with the availability of data from several in-situ moorings within with the bay,
including Underwater Temperature Recorders (UTR) and an Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler
(ADCP). We test the sensitivity of the model solution to the application of boundary conditions
from three different sources, namely the BRAN, HYCOM and GLORYS reanalysis products.
Overall, our results suggest that the GLORYS-forced simulation is the best performing model
configuration, both in terms of nearshore temperatures and currents. The ensemble mean of
the three simulations however provides a significant improvement in the performance over any
of the individual simulations. We further test the model sensitivity to two atmospheric forcing
products of significantly different spatial resolutions, namely the ∼25 km resolution CFSR prod-
uct and a ∼3 km resolution WRF model for the region developed as part of the Wind Atlas for
South Africa (WASA) project. The wind sensitivity test indicates that the high resolution wind
product has a marked improvement in the nearshore current correlation coefficients, highlight-
ing the potential benefit of resolving fine-scale wind variability in modelling the dynamics of
the bay. The results of this report are intended to guide the design of an operational forecast
system for Algoa Bay with many potential uses, including the forecasting of oil spill trajectories
which could occur from the ongoing fuel bunker transfer operations (vessel refuelling) in the
port of Ngqura anchorage areas.
