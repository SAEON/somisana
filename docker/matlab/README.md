# Matlab/r2022a
Our MatLab docker image is the same as the official image - https://github.com/mathworks-ref-arch/matlab-dockerfile/blob/main/Dockerfile - except that we specify a userId for the matlab user. This is to allow for mounting volumes from the user with specific permissions. In the future this will also allow us to make use of the various toolboxes.
