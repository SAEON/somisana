# SOMISANA's operational croco models

## FYI

somisana-croco is a submodule from git@github.com:SAEON/somisana-croco.git. Make sure you know what you're doing before editing code in here, as the code relates to other projects too

## TO DO

Dockerfile needs to be updated, and we need to create a croco-tools docker image which can be used for all croco-tools steps

Compiling and running the model will be done using the separately created croco:v1.3.1 docker image

On the topic of Dockerfiles, somisana-croco can have it's own one (set up in that separate repo) based on the OpenDrift example, which we could use to do the regridding stuff, and remove it from the somisana toolkit image
